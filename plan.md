# Text-to-Abstract-Art Generation: Design Document

## Project Overview
Create a lightweight system for generating abstract art from 3-5 descriptive adjectives. Compare three different approaches for text encoding while using a pre-trained VQ-VAE for image generation.

## Dataset
- Original dataset: ~9,735 abstract art images
  - Training: 7,602 images
  - Test: 2,133 images
- Annotation plan:
  - 3-5 descriptive adjectives per image
  - Use LLM for initial annotation
  - Focus on artistic qualities and visual characteristics
  - Create controlled vocabulary while allowing for flexibility

## Approaches to Compare

### 1. CLIP Text Encoder
- Size: ~63M parameters
- Advantages:
  - Pre-trained on visual-language pairs
  - Strong understanding of visual concepts
  - Good zero-shot capabilities
- Considerations:
  - Larger than ideal
  - May need adaptation for artistic domain
  - Built for longer descriptions

### 2. DistilBERT
- Size: ~66M parameters
- Advantages:
  - Strong language understanding
  - Can handle unseen words well
  - Well-documented, easy to implement
- Considerations:
  - Overengineered for simple adjectives
  - Not specifically trained for visual concepts
  - Largest of the three options

### 3. Custom Lightweight Transformer
- Target size: <10M parameters
- Design goals:
  - Minimal layers (2-3 transformer encoders)
  - Focused vocabulary
  - Optimized for artistic adjectives
  - Efficient attention mechanism
- Advantages:
  - Smallest footprint
  - Domain-specific
  - Fast inference
- Considerations:
  - Need to handle unseen words
  - Balance between size and capability
  - Requires careful architecture design

## Integration with VQ-VAE

Current VQ-VAE metrics:
- Reconstruction Error: ~0.045
- Codebook Usage: 15.8%
- Perplexity: ~58

Integration strategy:
1. Map text embeddings to VQ-VAE latent space
2. Fine-tune VQ-VAE to improve codebook utilization
3. End-to-end training with text conditioning

## Evaluation Framework

### Metrics
1. Model Efficiency
   - Parameter count
   - Disk space
   - Memory usage
   - Inference time
   - Training time and resources

2. Generation Quality
   - FID scores
   - Inception scores
   - Human evaluation
   - Style consistency

3. Text Understanding
   - Accuracy on seen adjectives
   - Zero-shot performance
   - Attribute control accuracy
   - Interpolation smoothness

### Ablation Studies
1. Architecture components
   - Embedding dimensions
   - Number of layers
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Vocabulary size

2. Training strategies
   - End-to-end vs frozen VQ-VAE
   - Learning rate scheduling
   - Loss function components
   - Data augmentation impact

## Success Criteria
1. Lightweight model achieves comparable results to larger models
2. Handles basic artistic vocabulary reliably
3. Reasonable performance on unseen adjectives
4. Fast inference time (<100ms on GPU)
5. Small deployment size (<100MB)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Dataset Preparation
1. Implement LLM annotation pipeline
2. Create annotation guidelines
3. Validate annotations
4. Create train/val/test splits

### Phase 2: Model Implementation
1. Set up evaluation framework
2. Implement all three approaches
3. Create unified training pipeline
4. Develop monitoring tools

### Phase 3: Training and Evaluation
1. Train all models
2. Conduct ablation studies
3. Perform comparative analysis
4. Document findings

### Phase 4: Optimization
1. Refine best performing approach
2. Optimize for deployment
3. Create demo interface
4. Document final architecture

## Technical Considerations

### Development Environment
- PyTorch for implementation
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- GPU requirements: 8GB+ VRAM
- Docker for reproducibility

### Deployment Considerations
- Model quantization options
- Batch inference capabilities
- API design for service integration
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Risk Mitigation

1. Dataset Quality
   - Manual validation of subset of annotations
   - Regular quality checks
   - Backup annotation strategies

2. Technical Risks
   - Regular checkpointing
   - Multiple evaluation metrics
   - Fallback architectures
   - Progressive model scaling

3. Performance Risks
   - Clear baseline metrics
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Multiple optimization strategies
   - Flexible architecture design
