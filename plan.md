# Text-to-Latent Space Mapping Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for mapping text descriptions to VQ-VAE latent representations for abstract art generation. The system uses a lightweight transformer to predict latent codes that can be decoded by a pre-trained VQ-VAE.

## Current VQ-VAE Metrics
- Reconstruction Error: ~0.045
- Codebook Usage: 15.8%
- Perplexity: ~58
- Embedding Dimension: 64
- Number of Codebook Vectors: 512

## System Architecture

### 1. Lightweight Transformer
Target specifications:
- 2-3 transformer encoder layers
- Initial embedding dimension: 128-256
- Vocabulary focused on artistic adjectives
- Target size: <10M parameters

Components:
```
Input Text -> Tokenization -> Embedding Layer -> Transformer Layers -> Output Projection
```

### 2. Latent Space Mapping

Initial approach: Direct Prediction
- Input: Transformer output embeddings
- Output: Logits over codebook entries (512 classes)
- Loss: Cross-entropy between predicted and actual codebook indices

Alternative approaches (if needed):
1. Contrastive Learning
   - Optimize similarity between text and latent embeddings
   - Requires careful negative sample selection

2. Flow-based Mapping
   - More flexible distribution modeling
   - Higher computational cost

3. Score-based/Diffusion
   - More stable but slower inference
   - Could be overkill for initial implementation

## Training Pipeline

### Data Preparation
1. For each training image:
   - Extract VQ-VAE latent representation
   - Store corresponding text descriptions
   - Create train/val/test splits

### Training Process
1. Text Processing:
   - Tokenize input adjectives
   - Apply any augmentations/variations

2. Forward Pass:
   - Generate text embeddings
   - Map to VQ-VAE latent space
   - Compare with ground truth latents

3. Loss Computation:
   - Primary: Cross-entropy loss
   - Optional: Additional regularization terms

4. Validation:
   - Monitor prediction accuracy
   - Check generated image quality
   - Track latent space coverage
