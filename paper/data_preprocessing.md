# Abstract Art Dataset Preparation Documentation

## Initial Dataset Composition

The initial dataset was assembled from two main sources:

### 1. Abstract Gallery Collection
- Total images: 2,872
- Success rate: 100% (no failed copies)
- Curated collection of abstract art images

### 2. WikiArt Collection
Total successful images: 8,204
Breakdown by movement:
- Abstract Expressionism: 2,500 images
- Color Field Painting: 1,500 images
- Minimalism: 1,300 images
- Expressionism: 800 images
- Cubism: 788 images
- Art Nouveau Modern: 592 images
- Fauvism: 400 images
- Synthetic Cubism: 169 images
- Action Painting: 90 images

Total initial dataset size: 11,076 images

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### 1. Dataset Organization
- Maintained existing 80/20 train/test split
- Initial split:
  - Training set: 8,849 images
  - Test set: 2,227 images

### 2. Image Standardization
Applied the following transformations:
- Resized all images to 256x256 pixels
- Converted all images to RGB format
- Center cropped images to maintain aspect ratio
- Normalized pixel values to [-1, 1] range
- Saved in PNG format with 95% quality

### 3. Quality Control
Implemented checks for:
- Image corruption
- File integrity
- Color space consistency
- Duplicate detection using perceptual hashing

### 4. Duplicate Removal Results
Training set:
- Initial images: 8,849
- Duplicates found: 1,247 (14.1%)
- Final unique images: 7,602

Test set:
- Initial images: 2,227
- Duplicates found: 94 (4.2%)
- Final unique images: 2,133

### 5. Quality Metrics
- No corrupted images detected
- No low-quality images detected (based on pixel value standard deviation)
- All duplicates were likely legitimate overlaps between the Abstract Gallery and WikiArt datasets

## Final Dataset Statistics

### Size and Split
- Total unique images: 9,735
- Training set: 7,602 images (78.1%)
- Test set: 2,133 images (21.9%)

### Characteristics
- Resolution: 256x256 pixels
- Color space: RGB
- Value range: [-1, 1] normalized
- Format: PNG
- Quality: 95%

### Movement Distribution
Original movement labels preserved through preprocessing, maintaining the diverse representation of abstract art styles from different periods and movements.

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Libraries Used
- PIL/Pillow for image processing
- ImageHash for duplicate detection
- NumPy for numerical operations
- tqdm for progress tracking
- Logging for process documentation

### Quality Control Parameters
- Minimum quality threshold: 0.1 (standard deviation of pixel values)
- Perceptual hashing for duplicate detection
- Center crop for aspect ratio preservation

## Dataset Strengths
1. Diverse representation of abstract art movements
2. Clean, deduplicated image set
3. Consistent image format and quality
4. Maintained artistic integrity through careful preprocessing
5. Well-balanced train/test split

## Potential Limitations
1. Resolution limited to 256x256
2. Some information loss from aspect ratio standardization
3. Slight deviation from original 80/20 split due to duplicate removal

## Recommendations for Usage
1. Consider data augmentation during training
2. Monitor for any bias in movement representation
3. Validate model performance across different art movements
4. Consider resolution requirements for specific applications

## Future Improvements
1. Higher resolution versions if computational resources allow
2. Additional metadata preservation
3. Style-based stratification
4. Movement-balanced train/test splitting
