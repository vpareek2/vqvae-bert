Here's a high-level outline of the combined training approach:

Architecture Setup:
1. VQ-VAE: Takes in images, outputs reconstructions
2. Transformer: Takes text, predicts the VQ-VAE's latent indices
3. Combined Model: Links them together so transformer outputs feed into VQ-VAE decoder

Training Flow:
1. For each batch:
   - Feed image through VQ-VAE encoder & quantizer
   - Feed text through transformer to predict same quantized indices
   - Decode predicted indices through VQ-VAE decoder
   - Get combined loss from:
     * VQ-VAE reconstruction + commitment loss
     * Transformer prediction loss (comparing predicted vs actual indices)

Loss Components:
- VQ-VAE losses remain the same
- Add cross-entropy loss between transformer predictions and actual codebook indices
- Could weight the losses to balance reconstruction vs prediction quality

The key challenge will be managing the backpropagation through both networks while keeping the codebook stable. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?
